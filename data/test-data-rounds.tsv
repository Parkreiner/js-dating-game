It's a Sunday afternoon. You have nothing planned, no obligations. How do you spend your free time?	I'm afraid "free time" doesn't exist in my vocabulary. I am a very busy person. If I didn't have any appointments or events to go to, something would be very wrong.	I'd be spending that time contemplating infinity. Hear me out: an afternoon is just an infinite sequence of infinitely small intervals of time.	I dunno? Just hanging around the house, browsing random websites?	Eating my boogers. I can share next time if you want.	/I would go to a (?:park|coffee shop) and have a [gwrtefdal] time\./i
If you were deserted on a remote island, but could bring just one thing, what would you choose?	A phone to call for help, obviously. I serve a number of very busy clients, and would need to get back to civilization as soon as possible.	One thing, you say...What is "one"? What is a "thing"? We are all just electrons buzzing in the air; we are all connected.	Can I cheat? If I put a bunch of stuff in a backpack, does that count?	Either my comic book collection, or my mom, so she can make me dino tendies.	/(?:a )?(?:box of matches|book|fishing net|knife|a friend)/g
What are you looking for in a partner?	I'm not looking for a serious relationship right now. Maybe not ever. Why commit myself to one thing?	I'm hoping it yields something I can keep coming back to again and again.	I'm looking for my soulmate. Someone who completes me. I want to be with them, heart, body, and soul.	Anyone who won't make fun of me for saying that 2 + "2" is "22".	/Someone who (?=looks ahead to the future\.)/
Do you speak any other languages?	The only other language I need is JavaScript.	It is the case that I speak at least one language.	Does math count? I'm pretty good at math.	I've taught myself Japanese from watching anime. My favorite word is "onii-chan".	/.*/u
If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?	A queen ant. I would enjoy coordinating a whole colony.	Ouroboros.	As gross as it sounds, a dung beetle. I just like how they start snowballing stuff into one giant thing.	I wish I could be a pony, so I could be friends with Twilight Sparkle.	/(?<=A )(?:sp)hin[xX]/
