The Event Loop	The business professional with an always-booked schedule. Constantly juggling various things. You barely get one-on-one time before they've moved on to the next thing.		
Generator Functions	Barely anyone knows about them, but they have a cousin who is a major celebrity. Impeccable memory. Weirdly obsessed with infinity; has a really bad tattoo of it on their arm.		
Array.reduce	Textbook case of wasted potential. Has never been in a relationship that has pushed them to grow as a person. No one really understands what they do professionally.		
Implicit Type Coercion	Can barely do anything right. Still eats crayons at the age of 35.		
Regexes	The smartest person you know. Peering into their mind is like staring into an abyss. Only coherent 1% of the time.
